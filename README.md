# NOISAR

This is the core code for the artile of "Adaptive Modeling of Correlated Noise in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors" ([2504.12983](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12983)). 

In this code, we present a framework for reconstructing the full noise covariance matrix, including frequency-dependent auto- and cross-correlated power spectral densities, without assuming the parametric analytic expressions of the noise model. Our approach combines spline interpolation with trigonometric basis functions to construct a semi-analytical representation of the noise.
